  Once the code is cloned the user should do a few commands on the command line. First do "npm init -y", "npm install express sequelize mysql2", followed by "npm install dotenv".

  ## Usage
  The backend can viewed and used using Insomnia, where the user can view products, tags, and categories. The user can also do GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods in Insomnia.

  ## Testing
  Once the code is cloned and the proper packages are installed, the user can proceed to create the database using mysql and  using the schema file in the code. After that the user can proceed to the command line and typing "npm run seed" to seed the database, followed by "npm start" to initialize the server. Once those steps are completed the user can now use the database in Insomnia.
